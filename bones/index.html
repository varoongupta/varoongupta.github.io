                  <h5 class="card-text">Starting my first internship, I had very limited programming experience.  I was given a problem statement highlighting the company’s inefficiencies within their project development process. The company had the data, but was not using it to their advantage. After proposing a roadmap, I identified objectives and key results to ensure the final product is an accurate, easy-to-use eco-system that would streamline the development process by collecting required data from all departments, automatically. I learned as much VBA as I could in the first week to begin developing the solution, and continued to learn as I went on creating the product. I delivered the product in the form of a four-spreadsheet framework, that was adopted by the engineering, project management, procurement, and project development departments of the company. Each department would record their involvement with a project in their department-specific spreadsheet, then, every user-input is pulled into a central document and converted to a dollar-value project cost, which is also stored, archived, and used to generate cost estimations for future projects. As the company completes more projects, the accuracy of the estimations improves as well. My internship had come to an end, but the tool was implemented for continual use; ultimately, continual reduction of the company’s project development costs.

                        <br>
                        This first experience was a great break-through opportunity to start my professional career. The technical experience gained was amazing, but more importantly, I discovered my passion for problem solving. I discovered that I am driven by complex problems that require critical-thinking and analysis. As an intrinsically motivated person, developing innovative solutions is what gets me going.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Following this internship, I continued to seek opportunities to solve big problems. From various hackathons or case competitions to my subsequent internship, I have taken on problem solving responsibilities. Within the first week of my last internship my role had adopted an in-house tech consultant aspect as I was responsible for identifying pain-points within various processes, followed by road-mapping, developing, and implementing solutions. It is my ambition to make a positive impact on people’s lives, and I believe I have the potential to do so.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently seeking an internship position for Fall 2019. I would love to hear about your company’s goals and figure out where I can help.
